# RULE-ENV-008: Sandbox verification (no fake setup)

Agents MUST verify sandbox infrastructure is real before proceeding. Known anti-hallucination patterns in Z.ai Sandbox:

1. **Clone to subfolder, not root**: Code cloned into `/tmp/` or `/home/z/my-project/subdir/` is NOT served by the dev server. The sandbox server only serves code in `/home/z/my-project/` root. Verify: `ls /home/z/my-project/src/app/page.tsx`.

2. **Dev server is managed by sandbox**: Do NOT manually start `next dev`. The sandbox starts it via `.zscripts/dev.sh`. Verify: `pgrep -f ".zscripts/dev.sh"`. If absent, re-init: `curl https://z-cdn.chatglm.cn/fullstack/init-fullstack_1775040338514.sh | bash`.

3. **HMR 500 is NOT "it works":** A 500 response in `dev.log` means broken code, not a working server. Verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:3000/` must return `200`.

4. **Editing wrong location is silent failure**: Writing to `/tmp/my-repo/src/app/page.tsx` changes NOTHING visible in the browser. Always confirm you are editing files under `/home/z/my-project/`.
