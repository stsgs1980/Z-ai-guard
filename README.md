# Z-ai-guard

Enforcement layer for the Z-ai ecosystem: rules (what agents must do), procedures (what runs when a rule fires), and tools (the scripts rules call). All 17 RULE, 4 PROC, and 6 TOOL are ACTIVE with M003 + M004 migrations complete.

## Features

- 17 enforcement rules (RULE-MONOLITH-001 through 017) covering agent behavior, documentation, integrity, and work structure
- 4 active procedures with executable scripts: SETUP-001, UPDATE-002, COCHANGE-003, LINECOUNT-004
- 2 active tools: verify-docs.sh (integrity checks) and bump.sh (version management)
- 6-phase pre-commit hook with HARD enforcement (Phase 1 V-caps, Phase 3 skills contract) and SOFT warnings (Phase 4 co-change, Phase 5 line count)
- Auto-generated registry.json tracking all 27 IDs across RULE, PROC, and TOOL namespaces
- Cross-reference verification composing platform verifiers with guard-specific checks
- Complete M002/M003/M004 migration from legacy AHG IDs to monolith naming convention

## Tech Stack

- **Scripts** - Bash

## Status

| Component | Count | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| RULE-MONOLITH-* | 17/17 | Migrated (M002). Files in `rules/`, index in `rules/INDEX.md` |
| PROC-* | 4/4 | COMPLETE (M003). All 4 PROC ACTIVE: SETUP-001, UPDATE-002, COCHANGE-003, LINECOUNT-004 |
| TOOL-* | 2/2 | COMPLETE (M004). TOOL-VERIFY-001 + TOOL-BUMP-005 ACTIVE |
| instructions/ | 4 | COMPLETE. 4 PROC-*.md spec files, all marked ACTIVE |
| scripts/ | 5 | build-registry.py, co-change-check.sh, line-count-check.sh, setup-001.sh, update-002.sh |
| tools/ | 2 | verify-docs.sh (TOOL-VERIFY-001), bump.sh (TOOL-BUMP-005) |
| registry.json | 1 | Auto-generated. 27 IDs (17 RULE + 4 PROC + 6 TOOL) |

Pre-commit hook runs 6 phases: 0 worklog, 1 V01-V11, 2 G01-G15, 3 skills-strict, 4 COCHANGE-003, 5 LINECOUNT-004. Phases 4 and 5 are SOFT-warning phases wired via `install-hooks.sh`. HARD enforcement comes from Phase 1 (V11 caps) and Phase 3 (skills contract).

## Project Structure

  - RULE-MONOLITH-001 through 017 covering: answer before act, worklog, read before write, commit structure, no loops, honest reporting, work structure, sandbox verification, session start, documentation sync, integrity protection, anti-monolith, version bumping, pre-commit checklist, no Unicode graphics, submodule immutability, upstream write protection
- `instructions/` - 4 PROC-*.md spec files (SETUP-001, UPDATE-002, COCHANGE-003, LINECOUNT-004)
- `scripts/` - build-registry.py, co-change-check.sh, line-count-check.sh, setup-001.sh, update-002.sh
- `tools/` - verify-docs.sh (TOOL-VERIFY-001), bump.sh (TOOL-BUMP-005)
- `registry.json` - Auto-generated registry of all 27 enforcement IDs

## Migration Plan

Per STD-META-001 s11.2 and `Z-ai-standards/MIGRATIONS.md`:

### M002 - RULE-001..RULE-017 to RULE-MONOLITH-001..RULE-MONOLITH-017 (COMPLETE)

| RULE-010 | RULE-MONOLITH-010 | Documentation sync |
| RULE-011 | RULE-MONOLITH-011 | Integrity protection |
| RULE-012 | RULE-MONOLITH-012 | Anti-monolith (250 lines) |
| RULE-013 | RULE-MONOLITH-013 | Use verify-docs bump |
| RULE-014 | RULE-MONOLITH-014 | Pre-commit checklist |

Migration window documented as "NOT YET OPEN" in `Z-ai-standards/MIGRATIONS.md` because legacy IDs do not exist in the current ID graph.

### M003 - AHG PROC-XXX to PROC-MONOLITH-XXX (COMPLETE 2026-06-25)

| ID | File | Version | Level | Implements |
|----|------|---------|-------|------------|
| PROC-SETUP-001 | scripts/setup-001.sh | 2.0 | [C] | RULE-MONOLITH-008 |
| PROC-UPDATE-002 | scripts/update-002.sh | 2.1 | [C] | RULE-MONOLITH-013 |
| PROC-COCHANGE-003 | scripts/co-change-check.sh | 1.0 | [C] | RULE-MONOLITH-010 |
| PROC-LINECOUNT-004 | scripts/line-count-check.sh | 1.0 | [C] | RULE-MONOLITH-012 |

### M004 - AHG TOOL-XXX to TOOL-MONOLITH-XXX (COMPLETE 2026-06-25)

| TOOL-BUMP-005 | tools/bump.sh | 2.1 | [C] | RULE-MONOLITH-013 |

## Procedures

| ID | File | Version | Level | Status |
|----|------|---------|-------|--------|
| PROC-SETUP-001 | scripts/setup-001.sh | 2.0 | [C] | ACTIVE (M003) |
| PROC-UPDATE-002 | scripts/update-002.sh | 2.1 | [C] | ACTIVE (M003) |
| PROC-COCHANGE-003 | scripts/co-change-check.sh | 1.0 | [C] | ACTIVE (M003) |
| PROC-LINECOUNT-004 | scripts/line-count-check.sh | 1.0 | [C] | ACTIVE (M003) |

## Tools

| ID | File | Version | Level | Status |
|----|------|---------|-------|--------|
| TOOL-VERIFY-001 | tools/verify-docs.sh | 2.1 | [C] | ACTIVE (M004) |
| TOOL-BUMP-005 | tools/bump.sh | 2.1 | [C] | ACTIVE (M004) |

TOOL-VERIFY-002 (`verify-standards.js`), TOOL-VERIFY-004 (`verify-id-graph.js`), and TOOL-CHECKUPDATES-006 (`check-updates.sh`) live in **Z-ai-standards/scripts/** and are already implemented and active. TOOL-VERIFY-003 was retired 2026-06-18.

## Known Issues

### Phantom IDs in STD-META-001

STD-META-001 lists PROC and TOOL IDs with status ACTIVE pointing at `Z-ai-guard/...` paths. Until M003/M004 land formally, those rows should read `ACTIVE (planned)` or `PENDING migration`.

### Dangling Related: edges in 6 rules

Six rules reference IDs that do not match the ID format (`<PREFIX>-<DOMAIN>-<NNN>` requires 3 digits) and are silently dropped by `verify-id-graph.js`:

| Rule | Dangling reference | Should resolve to |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| RULE-MONOLITH-009 | `TOOL-MONOLITH-VERIFY` | `TOOL-VERIFY-001` |
| RULE-MONOLITH-010 | `TOOL-MONOLITH-VERIFY` | `TOOL-VERIFY-001` |
| RULE-MONOLITH-011 | `PROC-MONOLITH-SETUP` | `PROC-SETUP-001` |
| RULE-MONOLITH-012 | `PROC-MONOLITH-LINECOUNT` | `PROC-LINECOUNT-004` |
| RULE-MONOLITH-013 | `TOOL-MONOLITH-BUMP` | `TOOL-BUMP-005` |
| RULE-MONOLITH-014 | `TOOL-MONOLITH-VERIFY` | `TOOL-VERIFY-001` |

The ID-graph verifier reports 13/13 HARD PASS on the graph that survived filtering, not on the rules as written. Fixing requires landing M003/M004 with proper IDs and updating the rule Related: lists.
